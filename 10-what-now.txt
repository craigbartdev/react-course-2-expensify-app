keep working with react for info to stick.

now time to make boilerplate
duplicate expensify directory
take stuff out other than auth stuff

before git push do 
rm -rf .git 
to remove all git repo's for folder

git init     to initialize then commit
git remote add origin https://github.com/wavydomez/react-course-2-boilerplate.git
git push -u origin master


possible expensify app enhancements - show do you want to delete modal on remove.
show number of hidden expenses in dashboard expense summary
add support for facebook twitter or github login
find a custom domain and configure it with heroku

possible indecision app enhancements - deploy to web


possible new project - blog. with login page like expensify.
dashboard shows posts.
/create has form for title and body.

anybody should be able to go to readable link without logging in.
